## Inspiration

---

The inspiration behind this application created by [Stacy Samuels](https://github.com/stacysamuels10) and [Carlos Silva](https://github.com/CsilvaD99) is that food connects all of us. We both have family recipes that have either been passed down by word of mouth or scribbled on pages in a family book. We also know that so many other people from so many other walks of life have a favorite meal that isn't from a cookbook or foodblog. We wanted this app to be a repository for those precious recipes and be the place people look at for "Everybody's Favorite Plate".

## Implementation

---

If you want to download the repository and try this website out for yourself you will need to follow these steps. Check back soon to find a published version.

1. Clone the repository located [here](https://github.com/stacysamuels10/DC-Back-End-Project)
2. Make sure you have node.js and npm installed in your preferred coding environment. It would also be helpful to install and run nodemon.
3. Once they are all installed, in your terminal, run `npm i` or `npm update` to install the necessary packages.
4. You will need to create a database and create your own `config.json` file. This is where you will use your own username, password, and host. It is not recommended that you share this file or push it to your own repo.
5. Navigate to your terminal and run nodemon or node
6. With your local server running, you can open the browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to use this app.

Enjoy!
